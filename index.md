## Welcome to My ePortfolio

### Professional Self-Assessment
  This ePortfolio consists of three items that are toy programs from my computer science undergrad program in the areas of software development and design, in algorithms and data structures, and in database technology. I will be adding to it as I do some more in depth programs. So please check back at regular intervals. In the first artifact I translated from Java to C++ a program which reads tab delimited file with data containing the usernames, MD5 passwords, regular password, and type of account that it is. The program parses that data into its basic pieces at the tab points and requests and reads the user input of username and password. The program converts the password into an MD5 hash and compares it to the MD5 password and username read into memory by the program. It then opens correct type of file for the account type like a login with specific access would do. The second artifact is a for algorithms and data structures shows a binary search tree reading in a list of bid data and then giving the option of displaying all of the bids, finding a specific item from the bids, and removing a bid from the binary search tree data structure. It also implements a vector data structure and uses that to load the same bid data in a vector structure. This vector structure allows one to display all the bids then it gives the options to perform selection sort or quick sort. The third artifact uses python and the pymango driver to manipulate a mangoDB. It  uses a framework called bottle which was supplied by the university to connect with the database stocks and it creates, reads, updates, deletes, pulls the fifty day simple averages in a range, pulls all items from a specific industry, and aggregates an entire sector of the market data provided. 

### Artifact One - Software Design and Engineering

  This artifact starts as a Java program which reads username and password data from a file and compares it to username and password data entered by the user. The password is an MD5 cryptographic hash from a Java library. This artifact was originally created in August 2018 for IT-145 Foundation in Application Development the core Java development class.
  I selected this artifact because it was a reasonable length application which would showcase reading from files, parsing the information from the files, storing the correct login information, using a library for the MD5 password, and retrieving and printing to the screen the data in the authorized account type. The artifact was completely rewritten in C++11 to show fluency in both Java and C++.
  I met the course objectives in Part I software Design/Engineering by reviewing each structure in Java and converting the logic over to C++. I do not have any updates to my outcome plan.
  As I modified this artifact, I learned that C++ can be a little temperamental when dealing with stream inputs from a file. It doesnâ€™t have some of the built-in controls that a newer language like Java has for parsing out each item in the tab delimited file. I had to read a line at a time from the file then generate a stream split and store to a vector for each field. I was able to access the individual entries in the file and save those that matched the username and password file. There is also not a built in digest function for MD5 creation. In order to test the password which was in MD5 in the file I needed to find and integrate an MD5 conversion program. I found one that was open source and was able to test the output to ensure it was accurate. The program is fully functional because I tested the input and output at each stage in every object and object function.

### Artifact Two - Algorithm and Data Structures

  This artifact was the final lab for CS-260: Data Structures and Algorithms showing only binary tree functions: Load, Display, Find, and Remove were previously implemented by me in the lab. My work is only in BinarySearchTree.cpp the other files that read in the data CSVparser.cpp and CSVparser.hpp were provided in this assignment. It was originally created February of 2019.
  I am including this artifact because it starts by showing the implementation of a binary search tree and the related manipulations of said search tree. The artifact was improved by adding the vector data structure in addition to the binary tree this data structure allowed for the implementation of quick sort and selection sort. The artifact showcases my skills with algorithms and data structures by demonstrating the searching and sorting data structures and algorithms. Measuring the speeds on the different data structures when used with the different data sets is a useful way of demonstrating the efficiencies or lack there of for each algorithm.
  I mostly met the enhancements I planned in module one though I did not implement some of the more exotic searching algorithms. This narrowing of the variety of searching algorithms is the only change to the outcomes-coverage plans.
  I refreshed my memory as to the function of Binary Search trees and the implementation of vectors to hold the same type of information. As I added the vector representation, I learned a lot about quick sort and selection sort. Challenges came in the form of ensuring the algorithms met the specification. I learned a lot from the partition function that needed to be implemented as a part of the quick sort algorithm.

### Artifact Three - Database

  This artifact was created in December of 2019 for the assignment in which we were to create, read, update, and delete information from mongoDB using the pymongo interface. This artifact came from cs-340: Advanced Programming Concepts or now named Client/Server programming.
  This item was selected because it aligns closely with the manipulation of mongoDB using the python programming language. I wanted to show that I know basic python with the pymongo library added on. This example was more concrete than a lot of other examples that I was looking at. Many of the assignments in the databases classes required working in the codio environment and taking screen captures of the individual commands that were required to answer questions. That way of evaluating our progress doesnâ€™t show much in the way of complete artifacts that showcase the skills that we built. The artifact was improved by adding additional functions to the pymango framework and by adding tests to the main program which use those new functions. Between the new and old functions this short program demonstrates the ability to solve problems involving storing, manipulating, and accessing data.
  This enhancement changed a great deal since module one. I was originally going to use a MySQL script from my Introduction to SQL class but the class had been archived which caused me to lose access to the testing environment. Thus I am updating my outcome-coverage plan to include the pymango program.
  When I reflect on enhancing the artifact I realize that I had to relearn how to use mongoDB and pymongo. The original class moved very quickly through the material and it was a challenge to remember how to do anything with mongoDB. After several tries getting the syntax correct the interface became more straightforward. There are not a lot of internet resources that use the provided bottle library of scripts so finding references to help me was difficult.
